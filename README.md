## Assignment Overview: Prep: Chocolate Pizza


    - Rather than the “complete as much of the assignment as you can in the available time” approach in Code 201, your challenge is to get the HTML/CSS mockup to be pixel-perfect
    - Your column of content should be centered in the window, as in the preview image
    - Your solution does not need to be responsive in any way
    - Do not use any negative margins, grids, or flex positioning

### Instructions

    - Create and clone a new GitHub repository to house the code for this project.
    - Immediately check out a new branch in which to do your work.
    - Download and unzip these assets into an assets directory in your project.
    - Write your code in two files: index.html and style.css. You do not need to include JavaScript.
    - Use the included PREVIEW.png image as a reference; your goal is to match it as closely as possible.
    - Make regular Git commits with appropriately descriptive commit messages while you are working.
    - When finished, be sure to push your final code to GitHub and merge your branch into main.
    - Deploy your page on GitHub Pages via the options in the repository “Settings” tab.
    - Submit the links to your repository AND your deployed page in the corresponding Canvas assignment.
